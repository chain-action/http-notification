## Documentation
- [Installation](docs/INSTALL.md)
- [Usage](docs/USAGE.md)
  - [More about the app parameters](docs/ConfigYML.md)

## Testing
To test the fact of receiving http notifications, you can use the following publicly accessible services:
- https://pipedream.com/ (recommended, has a shutdown support)
- https://requestinspector.com/ (the simplest one)
- https://mocklab.io/ (beautiful)

__Important__: When testing other URLs (the above URLs are added to debug exceptions), you must  [verify ownership of the domain or page](docs/USAGE.md#protecting-the-recipient-page). 

### Testing with decryption support
A [special test server](https://github.com/chain-action/httpserver4encoded-notifications) with [protocol](https://tonlabs.notion.site/Notification-provider-onboarding-3dd961bce8954d0da80208b9a908c773) decryption support was developed to receive notifications
